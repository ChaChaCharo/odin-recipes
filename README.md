# odin-recipes
A practice recipes website, following the directions given at The Odin Project.

In this project, I will practice the following skills:

  - Basic HTML syntax and structure.
  - Some essential HTML elements/tags, such as: head and body, title, h1 to h6, p, a, img, table, etc.
  - Basic understanding and usage of git as a version control software, as well as setting up and connecting a GitHub account.
