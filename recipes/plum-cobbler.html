	<ul>
		<li>1 pound plums</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
		<li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>For the topping:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>1/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
		<li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
		<li>1 pinch salt</li>
		<li>1 1/2 tablespoons butter</li>

	<ol>
		<li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat a baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
