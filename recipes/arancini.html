	<h2>Description</h2>
	
	<p>A staple of Sicilian cuisine, <strong>arancini</strong> (or <i>small oranges</i>) are basically rice balls which are stuffed, coated with breadcrumbs and deepfried. They take their name from their shape and color which, after cooking, is reminiscent of an orange.</p>
	<p>Originally a traditional food for the feast of Santa Lucia on 13 December, nowadays arancini are found all year round at most Sicilian food outlets, particularly in Palermo, Messina and Catania.</p>
	<p>Arancini balls are often served as a side dish, like bread. Our arancini recipe features a <em><strong>ground beef</strong> and <strong>green pea</strong> filling</em>.</p>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>2 cups uncooked arborio rice</li>
		<li>1 large egg yolk</li>
		<li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
		<li>1/4 cup butter, melted</li>
		<li>1/3 pound ground beef</li>
		<li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
		<li>1/2 cup Italian tomato sauce</li>
		<li>1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed</li>
		<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
		<li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
		<li>2 large egg whites</li>
		<li>1-1/2 cups seasoned bread crumbs</li>
		<li>Oil for deep-fat frying</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Cook rice according to package directions. Cool slightly. Stir in the egg yolk, cheese and butter. Cover and refrigerate until cooled.</li>
		<li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in the tomato sauce, peas, salt and pepper.</li>
		<li>Shape rice mixture into 11 patties. Place one heaping tablespoonful of meat filling in the center of each patty. Shape rice around filling, forming a ball.</li>
		<li>Place egg whites and bread crumbs in separate shallow bowls. Dip rice balls in egg whites, then roll in bread crumbs. In an electric skillet or deep-fat fryer, heat oil to 375Â°. Fry rice balls, a few at a time, for 1-2 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.</li>
	</ol>
