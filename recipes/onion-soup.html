	<h2>Description</h2>
	
	<p>This <strong>French onion soup</strong> is similar to what you can get in a restaurant. It is made with wine and sherry to bring out the beef flavor of the broth and topped with two kinds of cheese to give it that bubbly, browned, stretchy topping.</p>
	<p><strong>Tips:</strong> You can use the slicer attachment of a food processor to slice the onions. You can purchase day-old bread, slice and bake it ahead of time, and keep it in a resealable bag.</p>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>½ cup butter</li>
		<li>8 onions, sliced</li>
		<li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
		<li>½ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
		<li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
		<li>1 cup red wine</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon sherry</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
		<li>2 quarts beef broth</li>
		<li>1 French baguette, cut into 1/2-inch thick slices</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed</li>
		<li>6 slices Swiss cheese</li>
		<li>6 slices provolone cheese</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Melt butter in a large stockpot over medium heat. Cook and stir onions, garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper in hot butter until onions are soft and brown, about 30 minutes.</li>
		<li>Pour in red wine and sherry; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until you can no longer smell alcohol cooking off, about 15 minutes.</li>
		<li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
		<li>Sprinkle onion mixture with flour and stir until coated; cook for 10 minutes. Pour in broth, stir to blend in flour, and simmer until slightly thickened, about 20 minutes.</li>
		<li>While soup is simmering, arrange baguette slices on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Bake baguette slices in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes, flipping slices halfway through baking. Set aside.</li>
		<li>Set an oven rack about 8 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
		<li>Ladle soup into 6 oven-proof crocks, filling them about 3/4 full. Place 1 or 2 toasted baguette slices over each soup serving, then top each with a Swiss cheese and provolone slice. Carefully place filled crocks onto a sturdy baking sheet.</li>
		<li>Cook soup under the preheated broiler until cheese is browned and bubbly, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
	</ol>
